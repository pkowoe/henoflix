Henoflix is a Flutter application inspired by Netflix, developed as a **personal learning project** to strengthen my Flutter skills and improve my UI/UX design abilities.

The project goes **up to the login screen** and was genuinely challenging, especially in terms of animations, layout structure, and visual consistency.
